> Description

A simple **Windows Forms** application in which we can play a simulation of a lotto draw. There are two modes in the game - a game with the possibility of selecting 6 numbers and a game with a random number draw. You can win virtual money if you hit a minimum of 3 numbers. Calculation system was created by me. 

Winnings calculation system: **jackpot / ((6 + totalDraws) * hitTheNumber)**
